      <h2>About Eric</h2>

      <p class="p1">
        Experienced Sales Executive and Business Developer with a demonstrated
        history of working in the Financial, Treasury Services and Tech
        Industry. Skilled in leadership, management, working with start-ups and
        a strong sales professional. Graduated from Nottingham Trent University
        with a bachelor of arts degree in Economics. Currently studying a
        postgraduate in Coding at Columbia University. Learning the required
        skills to make it as software developer. I am an enthusiastic and
        professional individual, keen to build a career in fields such as
        Technology and Software Development. As a Bilingual character, I have
        enabled myself to grasp languages and interact with different cultures
        that are further enhanced by my studies of intercultural management in
        Norway. I am quick to grasp new ideas and concepts and can develop
        innovative and creative solutions to problems. I am passionate about
        doing my best to achieve success which is the same way I feel about my
        personal life.

        a former President & CEO of a public company that was listed on NASDAQ
        and have over the years had responsibility for a great many staff. I
        have found Eric to be intelligent, enthusiastic, sociable with good
        inter-personal skills and above all completely ethical in his
        behaviour."
